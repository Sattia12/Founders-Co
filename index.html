                    <h3>Experience</h3>
                    <p>The First Robotics Program is an American robotics competition that challenges teams of motivated individuals
                        to design and build a robot that meets specific criteria for a given game. Our team worked diligently to create
                        and implement a efficient robot and strategy.<br></p>
                    <p>•	Successfully implemented strategies derived from analysing competing teams to maximize effectiveness, achieving a 3rd place finish among 60+ teams.<br>
                        •	Contributed to coding the robot's claw mechanism and movement using Java. Self-taught Java through various online videos and tutorials to keep up with the project's demands.<br>
                        •	Engineered and implemented an innovative piston-based claw mechanism for item retrieval
